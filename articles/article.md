# Markdown for Music Lovers


**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax.
It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using
a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for
writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a
plain text editor. As the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities
and unanswered questions, many implementations and extensions of Markdown
appeared over the years to answer these issues.
